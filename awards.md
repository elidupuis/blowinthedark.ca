Blow in the Dark Glassworks has been working with organizations for over 5 years and continues to build relationships with clients. Previous clients include: The City of Edmonton, Edmonton Pride Festival Association, APEGA, Capital Power Corporation, EMCN, HIV Edmonton and The Nina Haggerty Centre For The Arts. 

Designing locally hand made, custom glass pieces representing identity is what we do. Working closely with clients using colours and forms we create unique glass sculptures. Process begins with a dialogue about budget and timeline. Prototypes are made and then upon approval production begins and glass items are completed. 

For further information on working with the studio in creating your own custom organizational award please contact: <keith@blowinthedark.ca>
