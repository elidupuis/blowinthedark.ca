Imagine an heirloom memorial glass art piece as unique and beautiful as the life it commemorates.

Keith Walker’s memorial glass sculptures are hand sculpted out of hot glass and incorporate a small amount of your loved one’s ash into a design of personal significance that can include a favorite colour or added subtle detail.

Memorial hand blown glass sculptures are a meaningful addition to your home and make wonderful gifts for family members, friends or caregivers.

Work with Keith to design your special glass piece, it could be large enough to grace a mantle as a showpiece or simply created to fit in the palm of your hand.
