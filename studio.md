Centrally located in Edmonton Alberta, Blow In The Dark Glassworks was built and created by Keith Walker. A journeyman carpenter and emerging glass artist, Keith felt the need to invest in his own art career and with a host of friends and family created a backyard studio in Edmonton, Alberta. The studio has been inspected and is a licensed home based business with the city of Edmonton. Keith and his team specialize in large scale glass public art projects.

The studio is community orientated and supports local organizations  and groups such as: Parkdale/Cromdale Community League, Arts on The Ave, Kaleido Festival, Deep Freeze, The Nina Haggerty Centre, Edmonton Arts Council, Alberta Foundation For The Arts, Highlands Junior High and Alberta Craft Council. Believing in public education the studio hosts regular community art open houses and special viewings. Please contact <keith@blowinthedark.ca> for availability.

This hanging glass sculpture was installed in August 2012 by local glass artist Keith Walker of Blow in the Dark Glassworks and [Nina Haggerty](http://www.thenina.ca/) for the Arts Artistic Director Paul Freeman. For six months, Walker and Freeman spent one day each week in the hot glass studio, challenging public perception of disability by teaching the complex art of glass blowing to Roy Skoreyko, and Jamie Lâ€™Aventure two artists with developmental disabilities.
