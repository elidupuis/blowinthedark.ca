Centrally located in Edmonton Alberta, Blow In The Dark Glassworks was built and created by Keith Walker. A journeyman carpenter and emerging glass artist, Keith felt the need to invest in his own art career and with a host of friends and family created a backyard studio in Edmonton, Alberta. The studio has been inspected and is a licensed home based business with the city of Edmonton.

The studio is community orientated and supports local organizations  and groups such as: Parkdale/Cromdale Community League, Arts on The Ave, Kaleido Festival, Deep Freeze, The Nina Haggerty Centre, Edmonton Arts Council, Alberta Foundation For The Arts, Highlands Junior High and Alberta Craft Council. Believing in public education the studio hosts regular community art open houses and special viewings. Please contact <keith@blowinthedark.ca> for availability.
